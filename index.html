            <h2>Unique Insights for Selling Cars in Hawaii</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Island-Specific Regulations:</strong> Hawaii mandates a safety inspection and, in some counties, an emissions test before a sale. Ensure compliance to avoid delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Buyer Preferences:</strong> Compact cars, hybrids, and SUVs are in high demand due to high fuel costs and narrow island roads.</li>
                <li><strong>Inter-Island Sales:</strong> Selling across islands involves additional logistics, such as ferry transport, which can affect pricing and buyer interest.</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Platforms:</strong> Leveraging local online marketplaces like OfferUp or Craigslist can connect you with buyers across Hawaii’s islands.</li>
